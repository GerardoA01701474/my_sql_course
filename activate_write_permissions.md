Move your file to the directory specified by secure-file-priv.
Disable secure-file-priv. This must be removed from startup and cannot be modified dynamically. To do this check your MySQL start up parameters (depending on platform) and my.ini.

# To ensure that the MySQL server has write permissions to a specific directory (e.g., C:\Users\usr\path\), you need to follow these steps on a Windows system:

### Check Current Permissions:

Right-click on the target directory (C:\Users\usr\path\), and select "Properties."
Go to the "Security" tab.

### Add MySQL Server User:

Click on the "Edit" button to modify the permissions.
Click "Add" to add a new user.
In the "Enter the object names to select" field, enter the MySQL server's user. It's often "NETWORK SERVICE" or "SYSTEM" on Windows. You can find the user in the "Log On" tab of the MySQL service properties.
Click "Check Names" to verify the user, and then click "OK."

### Grant Permissions:

With the MySQL server user selected in the permissions list, check the "Full control" box under "Allow."
Click "Apply" and then "OK" to apply the changes.

### Verify Permissions:

Go back to the "Security" tab and ensure that the MySQL server user has the necessary permissions. The "Full control" permission allows the MySQL server to create and write files in the directory.
